# Spotify-Clone

Overview
A static front‑end recreation of Spotify’s web interface, built using HTML5 and CSS3 (no JavaScript). The design mimics the Spotify layout: a left sidebar for navigation, a main feed of playlists/albums, and a persistent music control footer.

Technologies Used

HTML5 – Semantic structure for sections, navigation, and controls
CSS3 – Flexbox/Grid layouts, sticky positioning, gradients, transitions, and media queries for responsiveness 
Icons & Fonts – Optionally styled with Font Awesome or Google Fonts for a clean UI
